## My Goal

To learn more about HTML/CSS tricks, specifically in terms of **CSS Flexbox**, **CSS Grids** and **New HTML5 Tags**.

## My Takeaway

I've been coding HTML/CSS since Highschool(2011). It's always been so difficult to layout everything in HTML/CSS. *I know it's been difficult for you too*.  Good thing that flexbox, grids and the new tags really helps programmers to have a better layout nowadays. I guess CSS3 and HTML5 were just new those days and didn't have the chance to learn them well that's why this 2020 I am improving my layouting skills for Web Development :wink:
